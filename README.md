## CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python: SJN, Priority Preemptive, and Round Robin

This repository contains the Python implementations of three CPU scheduling algorithms:

- Shortest Job Next (SJN) (Non-Preemptive)

- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)

- Round Robin Scheduling

Each algorithm is designed to simulate real-world CPU process scheduling strategies, providing insights into their execution patterns, advantages, and limitations.

## The project includes:

- Clear and structured implementation of each scheduling algorithm

- Gantt chart visualizations using Matplotlib for better understanding of process execution order

- Fair tie-breaking mechanisms (such as First Come, First Served (FCFS) for SJN and Priority)

- A main.py file that allows easy selection and execution of the desired scheduling method

- Calculation of important performance metrics such as Turnaround Time and Waiting Time

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to study and analyze different CPU scheduling techniques, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and educational value.
